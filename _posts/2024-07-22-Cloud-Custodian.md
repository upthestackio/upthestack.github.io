# Cloud Custodian Overview
## Overview

Cloud Custodian is an open-source tool designed to manage and automate cloud resources. It allows users to define policies for governance, security, and cost management in their cloud environments. These policies can be used to automatically take actions like shutting down unused resources, enforcing tagging standards, or monitoring compliance with organizational policies.

## Problems Addressed
Cloud Custodian helps users address several key challenges in cloud environments:

Governance and Compliance: Ensures that cloud resources comply with organizational policies and regulatory requirements.
Cost Management: Identifies and manages unused or underutilized resources to optimize costs.
Security: Automates security best practices, such as ensuring resources are encrypted and properly configured.
Operational Efficiency: Reduces manual intervention by automating routine tasks and resource management.

## Getting Started with Cloud Custodian
Hereâ€™s a brief demo on how to get started with Cloud Custodian and use it in a scenario:

Step 1: Installation
First, install Cloud Custodian using pip:

```bash
pip install c7n
```

Verify the installation by running:

```bash
custodian version
```

Step 2: Writing a Policy

Create a policy to shut down unused EC2 instances. Save the following YAML content into a file named stop-unused-ec2.yml:

```yaml
policies:
  - 
  name: stop-unused-ec2
    resource: ec2
    filters:
      - State.Name: running
      - type: unused
        days: 30
    actions:
      - stop
```

This policy does the following:

- Targets EC2 instances.
- Filters for instances that have been running and unused for 30 days.
- Stops those instances.

Step 3: Running the Policy
Execute the policy with the following command:

```bash
custodian run -s . stop-unused-ec2.yml
```

This command will:

- Run the stop-unused-ec2 policy.
- Output results to the current directory (-s .).

Step 4: Checking the Results
Cloud Custodian will generate output files that show which resources were affected. Review these files to ensure the policy worked as expected.

Scenario: Enforcing Tagging Standards
Another common use case for Cloud Custodian is enforcing tagging standards. Here's an example policy that ensures all EC2 instances have the Environment tag set to either dev, staging, or prod.

Create a policy file named tag-compliance.yml:

```yaml
policies:
  - name: tag-compliance
    resource: ec2
    filters:
      - "tag:Environment": absent
    actions:
      - type: mark-for-op
        op: terminate
        days: 7
        tag: "custodian_cleanup"
```

This policy:

- Targets EC2 instances.
- Filters for instances without the Environment tag.
- Marks the instances for termination in 7 days if the tag is not added.

Run the policy:

```bash
custodian run -s . tag-compliance.yml
```

Review the results and take appropriate action based on the findings.
