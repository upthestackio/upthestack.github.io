# Serverless Land - Re:Invent | Re:Cap 2023 

Following on from the overall recap from reinvent last week, I missed probably the most useful project I found whilst at the conference. 

For those not aware of this resource it is [Serverless Land](https://serverlessland.com/)

This resource piqued my interest not because of the show floor demos that the guys had on the show floor but because of some of the things found on the site.

For those that weren't there they had a streaming setup using serverless functions, [ServerlessVideo](https://serverlessland.com/explore/serverlessvideo) 

They also had a barista event driven step functions, obviously I grabbed myself a coffee. Much better than the dish water coffee you get at these conferences. [ServerlessEspresso](https://serverlessland.com/reinvent2021/serverlesspresso)

 "Event-driven architectures are an architecture style that can help you boost agility and build reliable, scalable applications."

## My serverless journey 

I am relatively new to the world of serverless, although have been interested in functions for a while and do believe in the future of serverless as being a preferred pattern for developing applications. I don't believe however it is the answer to everything. We still have physical application servers in the data centre!!! 

We also had serverless covered in [#90DaysOfDevOps 2023 edition](https://github.com/MichaelCade/90DaysOfDevOps/blob/main/2023/day70.md)

The focus I have had around serverless has been around data services such as RDS and DynamoDB. 

## Serverless Land 

The draw for me to this amazing resource is the example demo applications the team have made and put together. My thinking is I can use these code examples and project ideas to highlight why and how bad things happen and why even in the public cloud we need to have a form of data protection and responsibility. 

But thatâ€™s not all, this is going to be a great learning resource for anyone wanting to get hands-on whilst learning the Serverless pattern. 

I am only just touching the surface of this resource and I am hoping to dive into more detail and demos later on.
