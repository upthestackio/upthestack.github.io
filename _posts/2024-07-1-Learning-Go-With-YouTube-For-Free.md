### Learning with YouTube: Accessible and Open Source Education

Before we start this is a part 2 blog post continuing on from last week where we looked at a broader view of learning golang including more resources I have curated into a list and wanted to share. You can find that post [here](https://www.upthestack.io/2024/06/24/My-Journey-to-Learning-Golang.html)

Since the pandemic began, the landscape of learning has changed dramatically. Many of us have turned to online platforms to continue learning and growing in our respective fields. While there are numerous paid educational sites such as Udemy, I have found YouTube to be an incredibly valuable and accessible resource for learning. As a YouTube Premium subscriber, I enjoy ad-free content, but it's worth noting that all the content I’ve utilized is freely available across the platform.

**Accessibility and Global Reach**

YouTube’s accessibility is one of its most significant advantages. Whether you're a seasoned professional or a complete beginner, YouTube provides a vast array of tutorials, courses, and lectures that are freely accessible. This democratization of knowledge is invaluable, especially during times when traditional educational avenues might be out of reach.

However, it's important to acknowledge that there may be some countries where access to certain YouTube content is restricted. This is an aspect I haven't been able to test personally, but it’s a factor worth considering.

**Supporting the Open Source Learning Ecosystem**

Another compelling reason to use and promote YouTube as a learning platform is the dedication of the content creators to the open source learning ecosystem. Many creators choose to share their knowledge freely, supporting a community-driven approach to education. This aligns perfectly with my philosophy and efforts to help the community through projects like #90DaysOfDevOps and UpTheStack.io.

These projects are designed to provide resources and support to anyone willing to learn and grow in the field of DevOps and cloud-native technologies. Sharing knowledge and making it accessible to all is a principle I hold dear, and YouTube creators exemplify this by offering high-quality educational content at no cost.

**A Comprehensive Learning Path on YouTube**
